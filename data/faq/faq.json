    "answer": "I started to programm way back in school.\n My first programming language was Python. It was easy-to-learn.\nFor long a time, I got used to watch into abyss of the monitor. Trying to understand 'Why ze fuck this function is not working' and stuff. Graduated from school and still programming just for fun and hobby. Now it's my job.\nAnd I love it."},

    {"question": "steam", "answer": "https://steamcommunity.com/id/beebbeebboob/ \nI have to say. But I love steam.\nI got used to it so much, that I can't go without it for about a week or so.\nThis platform is so greatly made for keeping all my purchased video games. I've been here for 11 years! That' a big number.\nAlso some people will ask 'why do you blacklist everyone without even talking?'. First of all, trade-o-fuckers. Type of people on steam who will do anything just to buy your stuff for crappy prices. Second, bots and scammers. Bots, who will try to use your reputation just to scam others. I never accepted a single bot, but I've seen a pattern in their profile. Big numbers in TF2 or CSGO, no to little about themself. Low level and little friend list. And of course... Scammers. Those are just pathetic to spend their life, trying to scam some kid for about 20 bucks. No really. Indian scammers do much more, but those are special type.\nAnyway. I'm actually accept some people. But as my profile said: 'only if we played recently and we had a good time'."},
    {"question": "tf2", "answer": "GOTC. Game Of the Century.\nMan. This game is just perfect. Amount of content is huge. Game itself, cosmetics, maps, gamemodes, custom server, modifications, HUDs, Voice-lines, Comics, Wiki and more and more!\nOh... The memes and gameplay videos. Best of all.\nI can't remember how I got hooked. But it was after I played Portal 2. My first Steam game was actually Portal 2.\nI got interested when Mann vs Machine got out. But after a time of co-op plays I drowned into loveable project called 'TEYLA GAMES'. A couple of server. Dodgeball, jailbreak, VSH. But the mose favorite one was 'Zombie Survival'. I do not reckon how actually it was named. But it was GOOD. Survivor vs Zombies. Survivors have only melee(have to find weapons) and have to get to the end of the map, while Zombies(scout-baseballgas, heavy-bighealth, spy-backstun) need to kill all the survivors. Dead survivor converts into zombie.\nA simple mechanic kept me in TF2 for awhile.\nMy favorite class is a medic."},

    {"question": "ss13", "answer": "Space Station 13 is somewhat interesting game that I got hooked on. This is actually a perfect online RP game that does his job in making roleplaying quite good! \nAs today I'm an Administrator of project 'SS220'. Been plaiyng for about 1000 hours and more. And still ain't finished!\nAlso It's me who made a new 'Clockwork Cult' and implemented to 'SS220' a new map 'CereStation'. All people who helped with coding are credited in GitHub."},
    {"question": "clockworkcult", "answer": "I've questioned myself. Why I decided to re-implement an old gamemode? Is it for glory? Or for fun? I think both.\nWhen I was working on Clockwork Cult, I actually had a plan in my mind.\nAs today, some ideas were scrapped or remade.\nFirst of all I was looking just to make remake it as it was usual. But I saw the flaws that was in the old mode. Gameplay sucked. Tower defense wasn't best suited to SS13 and original coder vanished. Leaving this gamemode to rot.\nBack to my idea, which was just to make somehow the same as Blood cult, but with own approach.\nYes, the goal to ascend the god, converting was the same. But the magic spells were different.\nI won't go into details. You can read on wiki.\nLast thing. About scrapped ideas. I had an idea to return traps and watcher. Both never got a light on live. It was due to how much of content was in the first place. People would had their mind blown with more information. And it also just wasn't 'healthy' for players. But who cares.\nI think Clockwork Cult in his own position,is a good gamemode and can be compared with Blood Cult."},
